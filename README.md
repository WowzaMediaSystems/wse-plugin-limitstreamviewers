# LimitStreamViewers
The **ModuleLimitStreamViewers** module for [Wowza Streaming Engine™ media server software](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine) enables you to limit the total number of concurrent clients by stream.

## Prerequisites
Wowza Streaming Engine 4.0.0 (or later) or Wowza Media Server™ 3.6.3 (or later) is required.

## Usage
This module provides the following functionality:

* Specify a limit of concurrent clients at the stream level.
* Specify different limits across multiple streams.  
* Set client limits for RTMP, RTSP, and HTTP playback protocols.

The stream won't play for any viewers above the concurrent users limit. What these viewers see will vary depending on the behavior of their player.
